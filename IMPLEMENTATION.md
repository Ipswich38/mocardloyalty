# MOCards Multi-Role Dashboard System

## Overview

This implementation extends the original MOCards dental loyalty system to include a comprehensive multi-role dashboard system with three distinct user types: Patients, Dentists, and Administrators. The system now supports new client registrations, role-based access control, and industry-standard dashboard interfaces.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Role Authentication System
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** with three user roles:
  - Patient: Access to personal dashboard and benefits tracking
  - Dentist: Patient management and service redemption capabilities
  - Admin: Full system management and oversight

### 2. New Client Registration System
- **Dual Registration Flow**:
  - Traditional registration for existing clients with control numbers
  - New client registration for unlisted patients (requires admin approval)
- Multi-step registration form with validation
- Address and emergency contact management

### 3. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **Dentist Management**: CRUD operations for dentist accounts
- **New Registration Approval**: Review and approve/reject new client registrations
- **Service Monitoring**: Track redemptions and service usage
- **Analytics Overview**: System statistics and activity monitoring
- **Perks Management**: Create and manage loyalty program benefits

### 4. Dentist Dashboard (`/dentist`)
- **Patient Management**: CRUD operations for assigned patients
- **Service Redemption**: Process patient benefit redemptions
- **Appointment Management**: Schedule and track patient visits
- **Practice Statistics**: Personal practice analytics and metrics
- **Profile Management**: Update professional information

### 5. Enhanced Patient Dashboard
- Maintains original functionality with improved design consistency
- Integrated with dentist assignment system
- Enhanced benefit tracking and redemption history

## Technical Architecture

### Type System
```typescript
// Core user roles
type UserRole = 'patient' | 'dentist' | 'admin'

// Base user interface extended by all roles
interface User {
  id: string
  username: string
  email: string
  role: UserRole
  isActive: boolean
  createdAt: string
  lastLogin?: string
}

// Role-specific interfaces extending User
interface Patient extends User { /* patient-specific fields */ }
interface Dentist extends User { /* dentist-specific fields */ }
interface Admin extends User { /* admin-specific fields */ }
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on unified login screen
2. System validates against role-specific credentials
3. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
4. Session management maintains role state throughout application

### Design System Consistency
- **Consistent Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Blue to Purple gradients
  - Admin: Shield/Security themed (Blue accents)
  - Dentist: Medical themed (Green/Blue accents)
  - Patient: Original loyalty themed (Multi-color accents)
- **Unified Components**: All dashboards use the same UI component library
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach across all interfaces
- **Animation System**: Consistent motion design with Framer Motion

## Demo Credentials

The application supports multiple user roles with the following demo credentials (hidden from login screen for production readiness):

### Patient Access
- Username: `patient`
- Password: `patient123`

### Dentist Access
- Username: `dentist`
- Password: `dentist123`

### Admin Access
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Legacy Access
- Username: `demo`
- Password: `password123` (defaults to patient view)

## Key Components

### 1. LoginScreen Component
- Unified login interface with role selection
- Password visibility toggle
- Demo credentials display
- Dual registration options

### 2. AdminDashboard Component
- Sidebar navigation with role-appropriate sections
- Statistics overview with key metrics
- New registration approval workflow
- Activity monitoring and system health

### 3. DentistDashboard Component
- Patient-centric interface design
- CRUD operations for patient management
- Service redemption processing
- Practice performance metrics

### 4. NewClientRegistration Component
- Multi-step form with validation
- Address and emergency contact capture
- Password creation with security requirements
- Admin approval workflow integration

## Workflow Examples

### New Client Registration Flow
1. Client clicks "New Client Registration" on login screen
2. Completes 3-step registration form:
   - Personal Information (name, email, phone, DOB)
   - Contact & Address details
   - Password creation and security
3. Registration submitted for admin approval
4. Admin reviews registration in dashboard
5. Admin approves/rejects with optional notes
6. Client receives notification of status

### Service Redemption Flow (Future Implementation)
1. Patient visits dentist for service
2. Dentist logs into system and selects patient
3. Dentist processes service redemption
4. System validates available benefits
5. Redemption recorded in both patient and admin systems
6. Points/benefits updated in real-time

### Admin Oversight Flow
1. Admin monitors daily registrations and redemptions
2. Reviews and approves new dentist applications
3. Manages system-wide perks and services
4. Analyzes usage patterns and system health
5. Generates reports for business intelligence

## Database Schema (Conceptual)

```sql
-- Users table (base for all roles)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  role ENUM('patient', 'dentist', 'admin'),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Patients table (extends users)
CREATE TABLE patients (
  user_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
  name VARCHAR,
  phone VARCHAR,
  membership_id VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  loyalty_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  dentist_id VARCHAR REFERENCES dentists(user_id),
  -- additional patient fields...
);

-- Dentists table (extends users)
CREATE TABLE dentists (
  user_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
  name VARCHAR,
  specialization VARCHAR,
  license_number VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  clinic_id VARCHAR,
  -- additional dentist fields...
);

-- Admins table (extends users)
CREATE TABLE admins (
  user_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
  name VARCHAR,
  permissions JSON,
  last_activity TIMESTAMP
);

-- Pending registrations for admin approval
CREATE TABLE pending_registrations (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  -- registration form data...
);
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Real-time notifications and messaging
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-clinic support for dental chains
- Integration with external dental practice software
- Mobile app companion

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features

- Prettier for automated formatting
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design patterns

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control throughout
- Input validation and sanitization
